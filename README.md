This is a sandbox to test the GrowSumo Techinical Integration Flow

Open your /etc/hosts file and add a line that points kittur.com to localhost

You can start the application by running `sudo npm start`

This will start it up on localhost port 80 http://localhost or http://lvh.me

Since you have added it to your hosts file go to http://kittur.com to see it running 

You should stop here and read through the source code, you will need to read src/server.js and static/app.js

Go to https://growsumo.com
Sign up using your real name and email address
Sign up as a Company called Kittur with the website `kittur.com`

Follow the signup flow until you reach the end of step 2 (integrations)

You will need access to the stripe dashboard which can be accessed here
